# ender3Switchwire
This is the files I used to complete my ender3 to switchwire conversion

Y Axis is all <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire">Gizzle</a><br>
Everything above the Y is <a href="https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW">DaRk_dOg</a><br>

I ordered a 310mm piece of 20x20 t slot extrusion for the X-Axis<br>
xz bearing blocks are to suit T-Slot extrusion not v slot<br>

Skirt centres I modified to suit the ender3, and I changed up the end caps to utilise magnets

For a hot end probe I went with Euclid, and modified a mount to fit off to the bed
