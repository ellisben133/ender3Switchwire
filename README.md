# ender3Switchwire
This is the files I used to complete my ender3 to switchwire conversion

Y Axis is all <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Gizzle/ender-3_(pro)_switchwire">Gizzle</a><br>
Everything above the Y is <a href="https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW">DaRk_dOg</a><br>

Skirt centres I modified to suit the ender3, and I changed up the end caps to utilise magnets

also included quickdraw mod from <a href="https://github.com/hymness1/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hymness1/Quickdraw_probe_Voron_Switchwire">Hymess</a> which I plan to use
